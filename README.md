payload
=======

This is a payload I plan to use in CTFs after I gain access to a system.

Currently, it can get root access with:
- dirtycow

After root access is obtained, payload can perform the following features:
- exec /bin/sh

To use
------
It's as simple as:
```
$ ./payload
```

To build
--------
`make` should do the needful.
